# Harvard Art Museums API

## Challenge Ingenier√≠a Resuelve (frontend)
The objective of this project to demonstrate my technical skills in frontend development

Developing an easy-to-use application and consuming an api ([harvardartmuseums](https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docs) ) with an infinite scroll

## Installation and Setup Instructions
* git clone https://github.com/tuticapi/prueba-frontend.git
* cd prueba-frontend
* npm install
* npm start
* Then, go to http://localhost:8000/ to see the application running in the browser

## Live Application

[https://resuelve-harvardartmuseums.herokuapp.com/](https://resuelve-harvardartmuseums.herokuapp.com/)

## Main problem
My main problem is the definition of a simple design for the user as well as the construction of the infinite scroll because I had never built one.

## Architecture

The architecture chosen is a single spa page application because it will only consume an API and there will be no need to use logic on any server

## Trade-offs

* I should have built tests
* I should have made a sitemap
* I should have tested on multiple devices
* The graphic design could be improved
* Image previewer could be improved

## Best part of the code


I think the best part of the code is the infinite scroll implementation
